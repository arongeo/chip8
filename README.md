## ROMs
I have written some of my own Chip-8 ROMs for personal testing, but I don't really feel like sharing those since they are quite messy. I would recommend taking a look at [kripod/chip8-roms](https://github.com/kripod/chip8-roms) both for testing and gameplay purposes.

## Inspiration
I took inspiration from [starrhorne/chip8-rust](https://github.com/starrhorne/chip8-rust) and [tendstofortytwo/chip8-rust](https://github.com/tendstofortytwo/chip8-rust), but I didn't copy any of their code, and as you can see our code design is vastly different.
